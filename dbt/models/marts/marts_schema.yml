      One record per product_id which provides metrics on the national
      best bid (buy) and offer (sell) abbreviated as NBB, NBO & NBBO. 
      
      Takes the record with highest price for bids (NBB) and the lowest price for 
      offers (NBO) and pivots the data on product_id. 

      NOTE: 
      This isn't the real NBBO since we are only looking at one exhange,
      so it's not techincally the "national" it would be the
      "exchange best bid & offer" but I am was too lazy to change all the
      column names.
